### Valley of the Wind

This VR project is inspired by Nausicaa - Valley of the Wind. It takes you on a gliding journey across mountains and valleys to plant seeds and create euphoric soundscape.

#### TODO:
- Reimport tree_02
- Tree Soundscape
- Wind Sounds
- UI or introduction/tutorial into world
- Add tilt to the glider so when we turn it feels better - In Progress - Grace
- Figure out glider model - more V-shaped or with some indication of the front
- World design/Figure out how to deal with boundaries
- Make the terrain feel low-poly: update material and texture, etc.
- Acceleration and Deceleration when we go up and down
- Tree_02 is not showing 
- Add particle system to glider so flight trail is visible
- Playtest more

#### DONE:
- Combine all the work
- Add a soundtrack to the background besides the seed sound
- Add different tree models to seeds
- Debug planting seeds so they are planted at "correct" places (Seeds now despawn on impact and collide only with Seedable objects)
- Style the glider model (new glider yay)
- Debug particle system (bug was so so stupid lmao)
- Seeds now have particle trail
- Playtest
- Glider initialises player height and orientation on startup
- Limit the glider at certain height so it won't crash into ground - won't go through terrain, but
