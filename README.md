### Valley of the Wind

This VR project is inspired by Nausicaa - Valley of the Wind. It takes you on a gliding journey across mountains and valleys to plant seeds and create euphoric soundscape.

#### TODO:
- Combine all the work and playtest
- Figure out how to do with boundaries
- Make the terrain feel low-poly: update material and texture, etc.
- Add a soundtrack to the background besides the sound seeds (wind sound related to the speed, bird sound, etc)
- Style the glider model
- Add tilt to the glider so when we turn it feels better
- Acceleration and Deceleration when we go up and down
