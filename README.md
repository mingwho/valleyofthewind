### Valley of the Wind

This VR project is inspired by Nausicaa - Valley of the Wind. It takes you on a gliding journey across mountains and valleys to plant seeds and create euphoric soundscape.

#### TODO:

- Tree Soundscape
- UI or introduction/tutorial into world
- Figure out how to deal with boundaries OR create floating island world -In Progress - Mateo
- Playtest more


#### DONE:
- Combine all the work
- Add a soundtrack to the background besides the seed sound
- Add different tree models to seeds
- Debug planting seeds so they are planted at "correct" places (Seeds now despawn on impact and collide only with the water layer bc i'm lazy)
- Style the glider model (new glider yay)
- Debug particle system (bug was so so stupid lmao)
- Seeds now have particle trail
- Playtest
- Glider initialises player height and orientation on startup
- Limit the glider at certain height so it won't crash into ground (redone with mesh terrain)
- Figure out glider model - more V-shaped or with some indication of the front
- Wind Sounds (they work!)
- Add particle system to glider so flight trail is visible (tested)
- Add tilt to the glider so when we turn it feels better - D O N E
- Make the terrain feel low-poly: update material and texture, etc. (who needs polys)
- Reimport tree_02??
- Add new glider model to prefab - In Progress - Grace
